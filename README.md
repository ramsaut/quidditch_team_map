# quidditch_team_map
A small python script to generate a geojson file for all Quidditch Europe teams from the facebook list.

[The generated list can be viewed on the map](http://u.osmfr.org/m/140367/)

The raw_teamlist.txt needs to include the list https://www.facebook.com/notes/520617157981529/European%20Quidditch%20team%20list%202.0/1132582490118323/
Copy the div around the list into the file to generate a new version.
